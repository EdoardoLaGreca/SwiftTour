# SwiftTour

An Xcode playground for the official [Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/) documentation page.

By the time I wrote the playground file, the current Swift version was 5.9.

The playground's code is written exactly the same as the Swift Tour page, while comments contain reworded explaination.

Experiment sections are omitted.
