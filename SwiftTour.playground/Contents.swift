// `var` for variables and `let` for constants.
// Constants can be assigned a value exactly once, but it does not need to be known at compile time.

// Variable
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50

// Constant
let myConstant = 42

// Variables (and constants) can only be assigned values that match their type.
// Types can be optionally explicit, except if the initial value does not provide enough information, in which case it must be specified.
// Variables (and constants) without an explicit type infer their type from the value assigned to them.
// A variable's type is specified after the its name during declaration, with a colon between its name and type.

let implicitInteger = 70
let implicitDouble = 70.0
let explicitDouble: Double = 70

// There is no implicit value conversion. Type conversion is done by creating a new instance of the destination type.

// Strings can take up multiple lines when they start with three double quotation marks.

// ==== Control Flow ====

// `if` and `switch` make conditionals. `for-in`, `while`, and `repeat-while` make loops.

*/

// By using `if` and `let` together, you can work with optionals (optional values).
// An optional value either contains a value or `nil`, to indicate that a value is missing.
// A variable that contains an optional value is declared with a question mark after its type.

var optionalString: String? = "Hello"
print(optionalString == nil)

var optionalName: String? = "John Appleseed"
var greeting = "Hello!"

// An `if-let` conditional checks if an optional value is `nil`. It executes its body only if the value is not `nil`.
// If the value is not `nil`, it is unwrapped and assigned to the constant in the `if-let` condition.
// You can assign a default value to an optional value using the `??` operator. The default value is used only if the optional value is `nil`.

// The `let` keyword can be used in patterns and allows you to assign the value that matched the pattern to a constant.
// Once a case is matched (and its code executed), the program exits from the switch statement. There is no need to use a `break` keyword at the end of each case's code.
// To iterate over items in a dictionary, you can use `for-in` with a pair of names for each key-value pair. Dictionaries are unordered, don't expect any order when you use a `for-in`.

// ==== Functions and Closures ====

// The `func` keyword declares a function. By writing the function's name followed by a list of arguments, you can call that function.

    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}
greet(person: "Bob", day: "Tuesday")

    return "Hello, \(person), today is \(day)."
}
greet("John", on: "Wednesday")

// Tuple make compound values. They are useful to return multiple values from a function.
// Elements in a tuple can be referred to by name or number.

// Functions are special closures.
// Code in a closure has access to variables and functions that were available in the outer scope, even if the closure is in a different scope when it's executed.
// Braces with nothing before create a closure. The `in` keyword separates a closure's arguments and return type from its body.

numbers.map({ (number: Int) -> Int in

// Closures can be written more concisely.

// Single statement closures implicitly return the value of their only statement.

let mappeNumbers = numbers.map({ number in 3 * number })

// Parameter can be referred to by number instead of by name. This is especially useful in short closures.
// If a closure is passed as the last argument to a function, it can appear immediately after the parentheses.
// If a closure is the only argument to a function, you can omit the parentheses.

let sortedNumbers = numbers.sorted { $0 > $1 }
print(sortedNumbers)

// ==== Objects and Classes ====

// The `class` keyword, followed by the class's name, creates a class.
// Class properties are declared in the same way as a constant or variable declaration. The only difference is the context (class context).
// Class methods and function declarations are also written the same way.

class Shape {
    var numberOfSides = 0
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."

// To create an instance of a class, put parentheses after the class name.
// Dot syntax can be useful to access the properties and methods of the instance.

var shape = Shape()

// Use `init` to create an initializer.

    }
    
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
    }
}

// Use the `self` keyword to refer to class properties and methods, rather than local variables and functions.
// Creating the instance of a class is the same as calling the `init` function.
// Every property needs a value assigned. This can be done either in its declaration or the initializer.
// Use `deinit` to create a de-initializer. A deinitializer is run right before an object of that class is deallocated.
// To create a subclass of an existing superclass, add the superclass name after the subclass name, separated by a colon.
// Methods that override a superclass's implementation must be marked with `override`. Overriding a method without that keyword is detected by the compiler as an error. Same for methods that have that keyword but do not override any other method.

// In setters, the new value has the implicit name `newValue`. It is possible to provide an explicit name in parentheses after `set`.
// Notice that EquilateralTriangle's initializer has three different steps:
//  1. Setting the value of properties that the subclass delcares.
//  2. Calling the superclass's initializer.
//  3. Changing the value of properties defined by the superclass. (Additional setups with methods, getters, or setters can also be done here.)
// Use `willSet` and `didSet` to provide code that's run before and after setting a new value. That code is run any time the value changes outside of an initializer.

// ==== Enumeration and Structures ====

// Use `enum` for enumerations. Enumerations can have methods.

enum Rank: Int {
    case ace = 1
    case two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
    case jack, queen, king
    
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .ace:
            return "ace"
        case .jack:
            return "jack"
        case .queen:
            return "queen"
        case .king:
            return "king"
        default:
            return String(self.rawValue)
        }
    }
}
let ace = Rank.ace
let aceRawValue = ace.rawValue

// By default, raw values start at zero and increment by one each time. It is possible to change this behavior by specifying values.
// When one value is specified, all the values afterward are assigned in order, incrementing by one each time.
// Values are not necessarily integer values, they can also be strings or floating-point numbers.
// The `rawValue` property enables access to the raw value of a case.
// By using the `init?(rawValue:)` initializer, you can make an instance of an enumeration from a raw value. It returns either the enumeration case matching the raw value or `nil` if there is no matching value.

if let convertedRank = Rank(rawValue: 3) {
    let threeDescription = convertedRank.simpleDescription()
}

// An enumeration's case values are actual values.
// When there isn't a meaningful raw value, there is no need to provide one.

enum Suit {
    case spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs
    
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .spades:
            return "spades"
        case .hearts:
            return "hearts"
        case .diamonds:
            return "diamonds"
        case .clubs:
            return "clubs"
        }
    }
}
let hearts = Suit.hearts
let heartsDescription = hearts.simpleDescription()

// When the type of an enumeration is known (e.g. in its declaration), it is possible to use an abbreviated form to refer to one of its values (e.g. `.hearts`). Otherwise, when the type is not known, it must be fully specified (e.g. `Suit.hearts`).
// If an enumeration has raw values, every instance of a particular enumeration case always has the same raw value. That is, because those values are part of the declaration.
// If an enumeration has values (called "associated values") associated with the case, those values may be different for each instance of the same case. That is, because they are determined when you make an enumeration instance.
// Associated values behave like stored properties of a case instance.

enum ServerResponse {
    case result(String, String)
    case failure(String)
}

let success = ServerResponse.result("6:00 am", "8:09 pm")
let failure = ServerResponse.failure("Out of cheese.")

switch success {
case let .result(sunrise, sunset):
    print("Sunreise is at \(sunrise) and sunset is at \(sunset).")
case let .failure(message):
    print("Failure... \(message)")
}

// Use `struct` for structures.
// Structures are similar to classes in behaviour.
// One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code, while classes are always passed by reference.

struct Card {
    var rank: Rank
    var suit: Suit

        return "The \(rank.simpleDescription()) of \(suit.simpleDescription())"
    }
}
let threeOfSpades = Card(rank: .three, suit: .spades)
let threeOfSpadesDescription = threeOfSpades.simpleDescription()

// ==== Concurrency ====

// Use `async` to mark a function that runs asynchronously.

func fetchUserID(from server: String) async -> Int {
    if server == "primary" {
        return 97
    }
    return 501
}

// To call an asynchronous function, write `await` in front of it.

func fetchUsername(from server: String) async -> String {
    let userID = await fetchUserID(from: server)
    if userID == 501 {
        return "John Appleseed"
    }
    return "Guest"
}

// To let an asynchronous function run in parallel with other asynchronous functions, use `async let`.
// To use the value of a constant declared with `async let`, use `await`.

func connectUser(to server: String) async {
    async let userID = fetchUserID(from: server)
    async let username = fetchUsername(from: server)
    let greeting = await "Hello \(username), user ID \(userID)"
    print(greeting)
}

// Use `Task` to call asynchronous functions from synchronous code, without waiting for them to return.

Task {
    await connectUser(to: "primary")
}

// ==== Protocols and Extensions ====

// Use `protocol` to declare a protocol.

protocol ExampleProtocol {
    var simpleDescription: String { get }
    mutating func adjust()
}

// Classes, enumerations and structures can all adopt protocols.

class SimpleClass: ExampleProtocol {
    var simpleDescription: String = "A very simple class."
    var anotherProperty: Int = 69105
    func adjust() {
        simpleDescription += "  Now 100% adjusted."
    }
}
var a = SimpleClass()
a.adjust()
let aDescription = a.simpleDescription

struct SimpleStructure: ExampleProtocol {
    var simpleDescription: String = "A simple structure"
    mutating func adjust() {
        simpleDescription += " (adjusted)"
    }
}
var b = SimpleStructure()
b.adjust()
let bDescription = b.simpleDescription

// The `mutating` keyword marks a method that modifies its structure. Class methods do not need that keyword, because class methods can always modify their class.
// Use `extension` to add functionality to an existing type, like new methods and computed properties.
// Extensions are useful to add protocol conformance to a type that is declared elsewhere.

extension Int: ExampleProtocol {
    var simpleDescription: String {
        return "The number \(self)"
    }
    mutating func adjust() {
        self += 42
    }
}
print(7.simpleDescription)

// You can use protocol names just like any other named type (e.g. to create a collection of objects with different types but all conforming to a single protocol).
// If a value's type is a protocol type, methods and attributes outside the protocol type are not available.

let protocolValue: any ExampleProtocol = a
print(protocolValue.simpleDescription)

// The variable `protocolValue` has `SimpleClass` as runtime type, but the compiler treats it as a variable of `ExampleProtocol` type. This ensures that you don't accidentally access methods or properties outside the protocol.

// ==== Error Handling ====

// Errors are represented using the `Error` protocol.

enum PrinterError: Error {
    case outOfPaper
    case noToner
    case onFire
}

// Use `throw` to throw an error.
// Use `throws` to mark a functions that can throw an error.
// By throwing an error in a function, the function returns immediately and the code that called the function handles the error.

func send(job: Int, toPrinter printerName: String) throws -> String {
    if printerName == "Never Has Toner" {
        throw PrinterError.noToner
    }
    return "Job sent"
}

// An error can be handled in several ways.
// A way to handle errors is by using `do-catch`. Inside the `do` block, you put code that can throw an error and write `try` in front of it. Inside the `catch` block, the error is given the name `error` unless you give it a different name.

do {
    let printerResponse = try send(job: 1040, toPrinter: "Bi Sheng")
    print(printerResponse)
} catch {
    print(error)
}

// You can have multiple `catch` blocks, to handle specific errors.
// To handle a specific error, write a pattern after `catch`, just like you would do after `case` in a `switch`.

do {
    let printerResponse = try send(job: 1440, toPrinter: "Gutenberg")
    print(printerResponse)
} catch PrinterError.onFire {
    print("I'll just put this over here, with the rest of the fire.")
} catch let printerError as PrinterError {
    print("Printer error: \(printerError).")
} catch {
    print(error)
}

// Another way to handle errors is to use `try?` to convert the result in an optional.
// When the function throws an error, the error is discarded and the result is nil. Otherwise, the result is an optional containing the value returned by the function.

let printerSuccess = try? send(job: 1884, toPrinter: "Mergenthaler")
let printerFailure = try? send(job: 1885, toPrinter: "Never Has Toner")

// Use `defer` to write code that is executed after all other code in the function, just before the function returns. That code is always executed at the end of the function, even if it throws an error.
// The `defer` code is useful to write cleanup code. It can be written next to setup code, even though they need to be executed at different times.

var fridgeIsOpen = false
var fridgeContent = ["milk", "eggs", "leftovers"]

func fridgeContains(_ food: String) -> Bool {
    fridgeIsOpen = true
    defer {
        fridgeIsOpen = false
    }
    
    let result = fridgeContent.contains(food)
    return result
}
fridgeContains("banana")
print(fridgeIsOpen)

// ==== Generics ====

// Names inside angle brackets make a generic function or type.

func makeArray<Item>(repeating item: Item, numberOfTimes: Int) -> [Item] {
    var result: [Item] = []
    for _ in 0..<numberOfTimes {
        result.append(item)
    }
    return result
}
makeArray(repeating: "knock", numberOfTimes: 4)

// Functions an methods can be generic, as well as classes, enumerations, and structures.

enum OptionalValue<Wrapped> {
    case none
    case some(Wrapped)
}
var possibleInteger: OptionalValue<Int> = .none
possibleInteger = .some(100)

// Use `where` to specify generic requirements (e.g. the type must implement a protocol).

func anyCommonElements<T: Sequence, U: Sequence>(_ lhs: T, _ rhs: U) -> Bool
where T.Element: Equatable, T.Element == U.Element
{
    for lhsItem in lhs {
        for rhsItem in rhs {
            if lhsItem == rhsItem {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
anyCommonElements([1, 2, 3], [3])

// Requirements can also be specified in angle brackets.
// Writing `<T: Equatable>` is the same as writing `<T> ... where T: Equatable`.

// The end. :)
